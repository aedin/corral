Description: Correspondence analysis (CA) is a matrix factorization method, and is 
similar to principal components analysis (PCA). Whereas PCA is designed for 
application to continuous, approximately normally distributed data, CA is 
appropriate for non-negative, count-based data that are in the same additive scale. 
The corral package implements CA for dimensionality reduction of a single matrix of 
single-cell data, as well as a multi-table adaptation of CA that leverages 
data-optimized scaling to align data generated from different sequencing platforms 
by projecting into a shared latent space. corral utilizes sparse matrices and a 
fast implementation of SVD, and can be called directly on Bioconductor objects 
(e.g., SingleCellExperiment) for easy pipeline integration.
