\title{SingleCellExperiment to list of matrices}
\usage{
sce2matlist(sce, splitby, to_include = NULL, whichmat = counts)
}
\arguments{
\item{sce}{SingleCellExperiment that is to be separated into list of count matrices}

\item{splitby}{character; name of the attribute from colData that should be used to separate the SCE}

\item{to_include}{(optional) character vector; determines which values from the "splitby" column will be included in the outputted matlist. NULL is the default, and will result in selecting all elements}

\item{whichmat}{accessor; defaults to counts, can also use any other ones that have been computed/stored in the SCE (e.g., logcounts or normcounts)}
